QuPath 0.6.0 in your own language

Download any of the resource files in gui-localization folder and drag and drop them into the QuPath window. Then apply the new language by selecting it in the drop-down menu in Preferences -> Language & Regions -> User-interface.

With version 0.6.0, you may need to restart QuPath after changing the language. With version 0.5.1, you may need to restart QuPath for the new language to appear in the User-interface drop-down menu.

These files were automatically generated with [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) and may not be entirely accurate. Feel free to amend the strings and send me a pull request.

Also, let me know if there is a language you want me to add.
